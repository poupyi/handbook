# Must Reads

We love learning.

This page lists the most influential books or web articles that we have found.
You are what you read. All team members are expected to finish read these materials, 
although there's no rule on when you need to finish reading.

Please check back constantly and feel free to suggest new material in our Slack channel.

*All books here should have at least one physical copy in our offices.*
