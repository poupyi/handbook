MVPs see things differently.

MVPs challenge the status quo, and change things for better.

MVPs will never be complacent and we always want to achieve higher goals that nobody had imagined possible before.

MVPs believe in hard work. The harder you work, then luckier you get.

MVPs understand one's success is defined by the successes she helps others achieve.

MVPs roll up their sleeves and do whatever it takes to move the company forward, even if it's not your job.

We understand this is not for everyone and that's okay. 
But for everyone else who finds this exciting, you're in the right place.

You Are MVP.
